# Code of Conduct

We are devoted to creating a safe, friendly, and welcoming environment. We expect your behaviors to contribute to this. As such, we have a set of guidelines to follow when participating in this community:

 - Be kind and courteous to others.
 - Use welcoming and inclusive language.
 - Show empathy for other users.
 - Be respectful of different viewpoints and opinions.
 - Trolling, spamming, flaming, etc. will also not be permitted.
 - Keep criticism structured, constructive, and where it is wanted. Likewise accept any such criticism gracefully.
 - Hate speech such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
 - Private harassment, including the above, will also not be tolerated. If you feel this is happening to you, please reach out to one of us. We want this community to feel safe for its users.

These are standards and moderation guidelines, and as such are followed in spirit, not by letter. If you feel these are being violated, or someone is otherwise making the community unsafe, unwelcome, or uncomfortable, we encourage you to contact one of us about it.
